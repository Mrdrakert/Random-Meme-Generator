# Random-Meme-Generator
Based on the popular twitter "Shitpost Bot 5000"

To generate a meme, put some source images into the "1. Images" folder, and set up some templates.
Put them into "2. Templates" folder and configure them in the "config.ini" file. Templates must be named XXXX.png for example "0120.png". Example templates are already in the bot files.
